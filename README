Tiny kernel config for kernel developers using QEMU

Compiling a kernel with default options takes a long time
on machines I have access to. And it needs quite an amount
of disk space as well.

Compiling a kernel with "make tinyconfig" is fast, but rather
useless - all the important options are missing.

If one just wants to do some kernel patches the compiling the
kernel or configuring a useful tiny config can take longer
than writing the actual kernel patch.

This project is an attempt to provide a base kernel configuration
for kernel developers who are using qemu. The initial commited
version takes about 5 minutes to compile (as debian package) on
my 7 year old Intel Xeon E3-1245 workstation.

Recommended qemu configuration: 
	- virtio for network and storage
	- Some drivers supported by QEMU are already in the config,
	  but not all of them. If qemu refuses to boot up with
	  this config - typically change your disk settings to
	  virtio
	- serial console for access

Recommended grub configuration:
	- GRUB_TERMINAL=console
	- GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="console=tty0 console=ttyS1,115200"
	  (assuming two serial consoles, one as default by
	   virt-manager redirecting to tty0 and a second for
	  access with minicom or telnet)
